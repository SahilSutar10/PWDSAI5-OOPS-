        "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "a)Encapsulation\n",
        "- Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class.\n",
        "- It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is achieved through access modifiers (e.g., public, private, protected).\n",
        "- Encapsulation promotes modularity and helps protect the integrity of the data by providing controlled access.\n",
        "\n",
        "b)Abstraction\n",
        "- Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the necessary and relevant parts.\n",
        "- This is typically achieved through abstract classes or interfaces.\n",
        "- Abstraction helps reduce complexity and improve code maintainability by focusing on \"what\" an object does rather than \"how\" it does it.\n",
        "\n",
        "c)Inheritance\n",
        "- Inheritance allows one class (child or subclass) to inherit the attributes and methods of another class (parent or superclass).\n",
        "- This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "- It also allows for the extension or customization of behavior in the subclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "d)Polymorphism\n",
        "- Polymorphism enables a single interface to represent different types of behavior.\n",
        "- This can occur through method overloading (same method name with different parameters) or method overriding (redefining a method in a subclass).\n",
        "- It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enhancing flexibility and scalability.\n",
        "\n",
        "e)Composition (or Association)\n",
        "Composition refers to the design principle where objects are composed of other objects.\n",
        "Instead of inheriting functionality, a class can achieve its behavior by containing instances of other classes as part of its properties.\n",
        "This principle promotes a \"has-a\" relationship rather than an \"is-a\" relationship (used in inheritance).\n",
        "These principles work together to create robust, reusable, and maintainable code in OOP systems.'''"
